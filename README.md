# df-mod2-forensic-copy
A reposotory for module2 project2
I had a long list of comments and accidentally deleted them. I don'ty remember most ofg what I wrote. I followed the instructions in the Assignment and had to get help from co-pilot to know the necessary PowerShell commands to complete it, However, even with it's help I still spent hours working on this assignment trying to learn what I need to know to succeed in this course. I know now to definitely use co-pilot. It has saved my bacon a lot this time.
